Blackjack is a card game played against a dealer. At the start of a round, 
both player and dealer are dealt 2 cards. The player can only see one of the
dealer’s cards. The goal of the game is to get the value of our cards as
close to 21 as possible, without crossing 21. The value of each card is
listed below.

    - 10/Jack/Queen/King → 10
    - 2 through 9 → Same value as card
    - Ace → 1 or 11 (Player’s choice)
